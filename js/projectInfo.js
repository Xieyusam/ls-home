Low-carbon campus is a service plan that combines scientific technology and humanities and arts to achieve the goal of a sustainable ecological campus. It guides teachers and students to practice low-carbon behaviors through behavioral science methods, spreads the concept of green and low-carbon through artistic actions, and leads social low-carbon fashion through innovative scene experiences. It has the advantages of being lightweight, low-threshold, and inclusive, aiming to explore and construct a low-carbon campus model that is suitable for local conditions, integrates science and art, and is organically regenerative.

I. Concept First: Proposes the design proposition of "the academy is the community, low-carbon is fashion". With the goal of achieving a sustainable ecological campus, it is based on an international perspective and local practice, from vision construction to design methods, from content innovation to practical paths, from teacher-student resonance to resource sharing, aiming to explore and construct a more vivid, more charming, and more beautiful ecological sustainable development plan, providing a low-carbon campus model that is suitable for local conditions, integrates science and art, and is organically regenerative.

II. Architectural Breakthrough: It's not just about energy consumption, but also a systematic reconstruction of lifestyles and production methods. Using innovative design thinking to integrate resources such as technology, tools, and communities, it guides teachers and students to "proactively be low-carbon" through behavioral science methods, and constructs a low-carbon campus system architecture with the path of "data insight - behavior guidance - ecological network".

III. Technology Activation: Focusing from user needs to the organic renewal of big data and intelligent hardware. Fully explore the campus energy and carbon data resources, integrate information technology with user service touchpoints, from defining low-carbon campus indicators to monitoring and analyzing the energy consumption of dormitories, and collaborate with digital platforms to develop digital tools and design innovative digital experience content for multi-level organizational relationships.

IV. Scene Creation: From daily innovation in living, teaching, and exhibition to new social interactions. Create a green, healthy, and sustainable campus learning and living scene system, link a campus carbon inclusive system driven by low-carbon creation, low-carbon behavior, low-carbon rights, and low-carbon blockchain, and create a low-carbon lifestyle, create low-carbon economic value, and promote low-carbon as a new fashion that drives the transformation and development of the whole society.

World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS Prizes) Electronic Environment Category Champion Award 2022, selected as one of "Hangzhou's Top Ten Low-Carbon Scenes" in 2022, selected for the "Fourth China Design Exhibition" in 2022, selected in "Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality in the Digital Age" "Chinese Wisdom and Chinese Solutions" in 2022, and shortlisted for the IF Social Impact 2022.

    text: 'How can blind and sighted individuals play together? The natural disparity in visual abilities often poses challenges for fair competition in social play. This can diminish the confidence of visually impaired (VI) individuals and reduce engagement for sighted players. While previous literature has incorporated fairness design strategies for the VI, we additionally aim to address the potential problem of boredom for sighted players by providing enhanced visual feedback without compromising fairness as a novel design strategy. We present "Hearing the Bullseye", an archery exergame designed for harmonious play between VI individuals and their sighted family and friends. Players use a bow equipped with an infrared sensor, allowing them to target an unseen bullseye using sound rather than sight. An empirical study involving 18 sighted and VI participants demonstrated that the design strategies used in "Hearing the Bullseye" effectively promote social engagement among both groups while ensuring fair competition.

Hear the bullseye is a cs shooting APP game that uses AI yolo visual algorithm technology to find the bull's-eye or move the player's position with real-time auditory and tactile feedback, so that the visually impaired and ordinary people can experience the sound version of the CS shooting APP game by using ears instead of eyes . Players on both sides can use the mobile phone camera to identify the color "bullseye" of the enemy's movement. Identify its location by sound, and complete the shooting in combination with the sound interaction of the APP. The interactive mode of game design can increase players' interest in sports games, and at the same time promote mutual understanding and communication between visually impaired and sighted people.

This study employs an ethnographic experiential futures methodology to envision AI-driven melodic auditory augmentation beyond traditional descriptive approaches for spontaneous social interactions involving VI individuals. We propose a mid-fidelity research probe: "See Sing," a smart glasses application that translates facial expressions, gestures, and environmental cues into emotionally contextual soundscapes, akin to real-time cinematic scoring. Our findings indicate that this melodic augmentation not only facilitates VI users’ spontaneous interactions with strangers but also enhances their comprehension of emotional nuances in multi-person dialogues. However, the research also unveils ethical concerns, particularly regarding potential misunderstandings arising from AI biases in interpreting social subtleties. This work contributes to the discourse on the intersection of AI, assistive technology, and social interaction in our increasingly tech-mediated world, raising critical questions about the future of sensory augmentation and its societal implications.`,
